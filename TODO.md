## Results

Need to run out final communities with hmat and lma for plant, ideally so that the evolutionary trajectory can be determined.  That introduces a dependency on plant.assembly unfortunately.  It also would require explaining the assembly bits, which I don't feel like we want to do at present.

There's no discussion of the density dependence for plant.  I think that we only just finished running that out when we last looked at it.  There's no really nice way of doing this unfortunately.

If we computed Abrams kernels then these need doing at the same time, too.

# comments from Russel Dinnage

ln 265 --  Clarify how each of components enabling calculation of alpha are obtained from other models, i.e. that there are functions which give this.
   - what are requirements for specialised for this work, i.e. wouldn't work with cycling or multiple solutions
   - is quite abstract, so good to make

ln  274 -- clarify that only valid under strict assumptions



could possibly make stronger case that models might in principle be compatible, before comparing kernels
  - e.g. logistic population growth, carrying capacity exists,
  - otherwise faor to ask why we might expect them to map onto each other


logic across paper is a little bit circular


ln 410:


Fig S3b: -- add value of residents carrying capacity. Make clearer link potential in panel

What about a 2D version-- in suppmat we vary density and look at change in kernel, but instead of varying density could vary other trait (e.g. height) while looking at LMA kernel.

Figure 5: thought process on what would be needed to get equalising or stabilising selection.

Also, what would it be if you switch resident and invader, i.e. what is inverse?


Sidenote: Stabilising vs equalising, originally derived in Chesson 1990

Peter Abrams would be good person to comment, he's good at finding fatal flaws!




Introduction

- connection with trait literature 
	- trait mechanism: connection to competition
	- all assume links

Abrams 2008

- looks at Tilman model but ot in reln to traits

Move from competition coefficient to competition kernel -- equivalent to moving from spp to traits


Add to discussion

- coexistence
	1.
-
