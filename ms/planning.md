## Introduction

Competition kernels are widely used in both models and arguments.  They represent the fitness landscape drawdown.

Largely unchanged from the 1960s, Lotka-Volterra equations.  But have been criticised from the outset.

Shift in the 1980s from modelling limiting similarity in terms of resources to modelling trait divergence/convergence and disruptive selection.

R* exists as another strand of modelling that seeks to explain how species coexist.  Draws from similar points but largely separate literature.  Other similar cases include the "sessile dynamics" work that leads to neutral theory.

## Discussion

Short list of main issues with models
  - No clear generalisation yet about competition kernel shapes
    - our lma kernel looks a little like the roughgarden offset Gaussian
    - our hmat kernel looks like kisdi's asymmetric kernel.
  - Kernels other than Gaussian may lead to coexistance
  - Other points: density dependent competition, shape of r and K with respect to traits

Traits are a productive way forward

(Maybe) link to field measurement of competition.  Measures of discrete competition 

Trait-resource utility linkage is important, but largely ignored.  Mechanistic models provide some sort of way forward.
