The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

The consumers in these models are dependent upon two resources, an adequate supply of each being required for population growth to occur. Simple differential equation models of competition between two consumers for such essential resources usually exhibit nonconstant competition coefficients whose magnitude depends on the parameters of the resource growth model. The equilibrium densities of the two consumer species are generally not linearly related. Constant competition coefficients can occur if the functional responses of a given consumer on the two resources differ by a constant factor. Differences between the conclusions reached by G. D. Tilman (1982, “Resource Competition and Community Structure,” Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, NJ) and those described above are analyzed.},

A triangular model based upon the three strategies may be reconciled with the theory of r- and K-selection, provides an insight into the processes of vegetation succession and dominance, and appears to be capable of extension to fungi and to animals.},
