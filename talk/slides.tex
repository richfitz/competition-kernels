  % Interspecific competition as a function of species traits makes it
  % into many ecological and evolutionary models: models of
  % coexistance, character evolution, etc.
  % 
  % The way we model it is very simple: usually we imagine species
  % compete most strongly with themselves and less strongly with
  % things very different from themselves -- practically we model that
  % as a gaussian function in trait space.
  % 
  % This leads to so-called limiting similarity, where species are
  % spaced along a trait axis.
  %
  % This is usually motivated by imagining that species use resources
  % along a correlated axis with some optimium.

  % This sort of idea seems to have stronger roots in animal work -
  % it's less clear how these sorts of trait and resource axes should
  % apply to plants, who compete for relatively few resources.
  %
  % In particular traits that are thought to affect use of light and
  % other resources like specific leaf area don't map on to different
  % resources but to rates of uses of resources.
  %
  % So it's therefore very hard to see how to build a bridge between
  % our simple abstract models of competition and the types of traits
  % and species data that we tend to collect for plant communities.

  % with two models: a simplest abstract model and a complicated

  What do competition kernels look like\\[.5ex]
  in models with \textbf{\color{orange-dk}implicit} competition?
  % The approach is simple minded: focus on invasion fitness of rare
  % mutants across trait space in the presence of a single resident.
  % Compute all the components of the MacArthur and Levins model:
  % fitness, mutant carrying capacity, mutant maximum growth rate and
  % resident density, to work out the per-capita effect of competition
  % of the resident on the invading species.

  % Simplest model we could think of is Tilman's R* model, developed
  % through the 1980s, but still in widespread use.

  % The model has similar ingredients to the ML/LV model, but resource
  % regeneration does not happen instantaneously.

  % Species compete for and consume some number of resources -- at most
  % 'n' species can coexist on 'n' resources.

\begin{frame}{R star with one resource}
  \begin{center}
    \vspace{-4ex}
    % With a single resource, a single species only can exist.
    % 
    % Here the species are characterised by their resource requirement
    % along the x axis -- this is the amount of resource required to
    % generate one offspring.
    % 
    % The species with the lowest requirement wins, so anything with a
    % lower requirement (to the left of the resident) can invade.
    % 
    % If you compute the competition kernel for this, it is asymmetric
    % and corresponds to our intuition here: species can invade where
    % they experience less competition than the resident species
    % exerts on itself (at 1)

\begin{frame}{R star with two resources}
  % Things start to get weirder with two resources.
  %
  % Imagine that the requirements for two essential resources
  % trade-off so that this maps to a single trait axis.
  % 
  % Species to the far left are specialists on resource A and species
  % to the far right are specialists on resource B.
  \begin{center}
    \vspace{-4ex}
    % This generates a weird and nondifferentiable kernel.

  \end{center}
  % This kernel is unsurprisingly also not constant with respect to
  % resident density (and the shape moves around as resident density
  % changes).

  % So this is weird: the most commonly used *implicit* model of
  % competition, often used in thought experiments about coexistance,
  % does not line up with the assumptions of the most commonly used
  % *explicit* models of competition.
  % 
  % Given that conclusions in the explicit model will depend on things
  % like the ratio of widths of the competition and carrying capacity
  % kernel (Dieckmann and Doebelli) or on the details of the spectral
  % composition of the kernsl (Leimar) these departures will at least
  % quantitatively change the conclusions of these models.

\begin{frame}% {Linking to biological traits}
  % TODO: Uncertain if a slide heading through this (and the previous)
  % section are useful.

  % OK, but the R* model is still really abstract, and doesn't really
  % map onto traits that we see in nature (things like the LES affect
  % resource use but don't directly map onto it).

  % Ideally what *I'd* like to see is what these kernels look like in
  % trait space in a biological community.  But I'm not much of an
  % empiricist.

  % Instead, consider a mechanistic model where we model competition
  % for light, and incorportate information about trade-offs

  % Height at maturation is an obvious arms-race like trait in this
  % system -- the taller you are the more you shade out other
  % individuals, but the longer you delay reproduction.
  %
  % There's a lot of possible outcomes of this model, but here is one
  % - fitness tends to decrease with increasing height at maturation.
  %
  % However, the competition kernel goes the expected direction: the
  % shorter you are the more competition you face from the taller
  % species -- shorter species are able to invade in spite of intense
  % competition from the invader.
  %
  % This set of parameters actually leads to reasonable levels of
  % coexistance without any gaussian kernels or limiting similarity.

  % TODO: fitness slide with nothing on except for the resident and
  % traits.
  %
  % This trait generates really odd looking fitness landscapes, partly
  % due to how *time* is being partitioned.
  %
  % The competition kernel underlying these fitness landscapes is very
  % rugged with peaks and troughs.  Here, species with a lower LMA
  % than the resident can invade, but for species with a higher LMA
  % than the resident the landscape is very lumpy.
  %
  % As the resident evolves towards the optimim, these bumps move
  % around so that some bumps drop quite low - these regions of low
  % competition allow invasion of other types.  This is a potential
  % mechanism of coexistance that falls outside the scope of
  % traditional limiting-similarity style models.

  % I've attempted to look at how to link abstract models of
  % competition with traits that we actually have by looking at models
  % where competition emerges from the model.  So far, nothing looks
  % like the Gaussian kernels that we generally work with.
  %
  % This isn't meant as a criticism of the simple models -- there are
  % many resons to model competition and anything much more
  % complicated than Gaussian kernels quickly becomes intractable.
  % 
  % However, criticism of these models is as old as the models
  % themselves, especially by Peter Abrams.
  %
  % More concerning is that we don't have a strong idea about how
  % departures from the Gaussian kernel will impact models of
  % coexistance or of other models for which competition is a key
  % ingredient.  There is some quite theoretical work on this, but
  % it's still a long way removed from the really bizarre shapes that
  % I've seen.
  %
  % Ideally we can odentify features that mechanistic models, models
  % with implicit competition, and emprical data have in common and
  % make sure that our models that invoke explicit competition are
  % robust to these features.
  %
  % Measuring competition in mechanistic models has potential for
  % bridging theory and data.  Unexpected shapes and forms.  May help
  % with nonmanipulative estimation of competition intensity in the
  % field.  At least that's what I'd like.  It certainly seems
  % unlikely to be worse than the current crop of models.
