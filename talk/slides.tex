\begin{frame}{Why is competition interesting?}
  % Photos of things competing, perhaps.
  %
  % Definitely a graph of limiting similarity.
  %
  % Perhaps something from D+D showing a disruptive fitness landscape
  % and evolutionary branching.

  % Things to mention:
  %
  % Competition plays an interesting, and balancing, role in
  % understanding the maintenance of diversity.
  % 
  % On the one hand, competition is a homogenising force -- winner
  % takes all is one extreme end of competition.  So competition can
  % lead to a lack of divesity. [picture of grass? beech forest?]
  %
  % On the other hand, competition a diversity-generating force -- it
  % can generate disruptive selection that forces traits apart.
  % Competition is present in almost all theory abaout how
  % hyperdiverse systems come to be. [picture of tropical forest]
  %
  % This antagonistic dual role leads to the "paradox of the plankton"
  % -- how do species, especially primary producers, that compete for
  % relatively few key resources reach high levels of diversity
  %
  % Competition is central to how with think about trait evolution
  % through charater displacement, niche evolution and limiting
  % similarity.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Why, and when, does evolution favour diversity?
  \item Competition reduces diversity (competitive exclusion) and
    generates/maintains it (disruptive selection).  It shapes fitness
    landscapes so affects how traits evolve.
  \item Central to ideas of ``limiting similarity'' and niche
    structuring that shape evolutionary thought
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{How do we model competition?}
  % Despite the centrality of the idea, the way we model competition
  % is surprisingly simple.  When competition is assumed into a model,
  % we tend to reach for the simplest cases -- that's fine, but these
  % are usually variants on the MacArthur and Levins model from 1967,
  % itself a modification of the Lotka--Volterra models of the 30s.

  % No need to go into the model in any detail, but just say that it
  % is a mix of the LV and logistic models, and list the assumptions.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Simple models, usually based on Lotka-Volterra equations and
    MacArthur and Levins 1967.
  \item Combination of logistic growth and the Lotka-Volterra
    equations.
  \end{itemize}

  Implies competition will be
  \begin{itemize}
  \item constant with respect to densities of all species
  \item linear in species density
  \item linear over all species in the community
  \item generally assumes competition is gaussian in trait space
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Plant ecology has become increasingly trait focussed over the last
% few decades, and has moved from counting "species identity" as
% important to trying identify major axes of functional variation.
% We can point at things like the leaf economic spectrum and say
% "That's a fast plant" and "that's a slow plant", but it's very
% difficult to say anything *in general* about how these traits
% might relate to competiton, and therefore to things like
% coexistance.
% 
% Pictures here: bunch of leaves with letters A - X on them, and
% then recast as a series of points along the LMA / leaf lifespan
% plot, coloured up.  So we want silhoettes I think.

% Need to get the link into *traits* here.  How did Georges do this?
% It's easy enough to motivate from the evolutionary end of things --
% competition generates fitness gradients in trait space, and that's
% what we want to focus on.

\begin{frame}{The MacArthur and Levins / Lotka Volterra model}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=.8\textheight]{figs/gaussian}
  \end{center}
\end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{The MacArthur and Levins / Lotka Volterra model}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Moving from species identity (abitrary matrix of coefficients)
%     to \textbf{traits} involves replacing growth, carrying capacity
%     and competition parameters as functions of traits.
%   \item MacArthur and Levins started the convention of Gaussian
%     competition kernels --- this has persisted through the literature
%     enormously [worth giving a list here?]
%   \end{itemize}
  
%   \begin{equation*}
%     \frac{\ud N(x_i)}{\ud t} =
%     r(x_i) N(x_i) \left(1 - \frac{N(x_i) + 
%         \sum_{j \neq i }\alpha(x_i, x_j)N_j}{K(x_i)}\right)
%   \end{equation*}

%   Usually $\alpha(x_i, x_i)$ is Gaussian, same for all $|x_i - x_j|$,
%   with constant intensity and variance.
  
%   % Really need a picture of a Gaussian kernel here just to ram it
%   % home.  Put species traits along the bottom -- that's going to be
%   % easiest if have already mentioned traits in some context, but it
%   % could be fine with finch beaks, really.  Might be easiest to
%   % motivate from resource uses too if we can say that assumptions
%   % that go in are about individuals using resources in a Gaussian way
%   % and under some assumptions this leads to a Gaussian competition
%   % kernel.
% \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How do we connect these models with real data?}
  %
  % Obviously models are not meant to be facsimilies of the real
  % world, but there are real issues here in connecting these sorts of
  % models to the real world.
  %
  % What I want to do here is look at how we can build a bridge
  % between these very simple models and the types of data that we
  % have, via mechanistic models.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Theoretical models framed in terms of \textbf{resource use};
    the ``trait'' is really preference for a resource.
  \item (finch and seed size preference picture)
  \item (picture of a tropical forest and a few plant traits)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Aims and Questions}
  % Much of the last point ends up here.
  % 
  % Emphasise the major research goal is to build the bridge, but the
  % current question is just to see what sort of competition kernels 

  \begin{itemize}
  \item What does competition kernels look like?
  \item Are the assumptions in the LV model reasonable?
  \item What would it take to build a bridge between theory and data
    that allows us to detect disruptive selection on traits?
  \item I don't actually have solutions for any of this.
  \end{itemize}

  Look at the competition kernels induced by one simple and one
  complicated model.
\end{frame}

% The approach we took was really simple minded: we focus on invasion
% fitness (the fitness of a rare mutant with some new phenotype) and
% compute all the components of the ML/LV equation except for alpha
% (K, r, w).  Then solve for the competition coefficient.

% Getting the flow right through this bit is going to be really,
% really hard.

% To start off, the first place we thought to look what what happens
% in the simplest models where competition is *implicit* -- that is
% competition is an emergent property of the model rather than being
% assumed in.

% Simplest model we could think of is Tilman's R* model, developed
% through the 1980s, but still in widespread use.

% The model has similar ingredients to the ML/LV model, but resource
% regeneration does not happen instantaneously.

% Species compete for and consume some number of resources -- at most
% 'n' species can coexist on 'n' resources.

\begin{frame}{R star model of competition}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Simple phenomenological model of competition
  \item Similar ingredients to MacArthur and Levins/LV model, but
    resource regeneration does not happen instantaneously.
  \item For $n$ resources, up to $n$ species can coexist at
    equilibrium
  \item Parameter that maps the rate of intake of a resource to the
    per-capita rate of increase ($K$).
  \item For two resources, we can set $K_2 = 1 - K_2$ so that resource
    use trades off (efficient with one, poor with another).
  \item There is also the rate of \emph{consumption} of the resource.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


% \begin{frame}{Approach}
%   \begin{equation*}
%     g_i = r(x_i) \left(1 - \frac{\alpha(x_i, x_r)N_r}{K(x_i)}\right)
%   \end{equation*}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item $r(x_i)$ --- maximum growth rate
%   \item $K(x_i)$ --- carrying capacity
%   \item $g_i$ --- per-capita growth rate of invader in presence of
%     resident. 
%   \end{itemize}
%   \begin{equation*}
%     \alpha(x_i, x_r) = \frac{K(x_i)}{N_r}\left(1 - \frac{g_i}{r_i(x_i)}\right)
%   \end{equation*}
% \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{R star with one resource}
  \begin{center}
    % Asymmetric fitness:
    %
    % Plot of w against K -- the resource requirement.  The species
    % with the lowest K can invade and resist invasion from all other
    % species.
    \includegraphics<1>[height=.8\textheight]{figs/rstar_fitness_1}
    % Asymmetric competition:
    %
    % So it's not surprising that the kernel shows the same basic
    % pattern: species with lower K values experience lower
    % competition than species with higher K values.
    \includegraphics<2>[height=.8\textheight]{figs/rstar_alpha_1}
    % Density dependence:
    % What is more surprising is that even in this really simple model
    % we violate one of the assumptions of LV: we have nonlinear density
    % dependence in competition.
    % 
    % Note here that the rarity of of linear competition density
    % dependence in both theory and data has been noted by Peter Abrahms
    % since the 1970s!
    \includegraphics<3>[height=.8\textheight]{figs/rstar_density_1}
  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{R star with two resouces}
  % Things start to get weirder with two resources.
  %
  % Imagine that the requirements for two essential resources
  % trade-off (this is an approach taken by other people -- I think
  % the Fox model at least, but check with Georges).
  %
  % Draw down resources until we hit the zero-net growth isoclines.
  \begin{center}
    % [classic 2 resource ZNGI plot, then alter to show where
    % coexistance possible]

    % Peaked fitness landscape - extreme specialists have low fitness.
    \includegraphics<1>[height=.8\textheight]{figs/rstar_fitness_2}

    % This generates a weird and nondifferentiable kernel.
    \includegraphics<2>[height=.8\textheight]{figs/rstar_alpha_2}
  \end{center}
  % This kernel is unsurprisingly also not constant with respect to
  % resident density (and the shape moves around as resident density
  % changes).

  % So this is weird: the most commonly used *implicit* model of
  % competition, often used in thought experiments about coexistance,
  % does not line up with the assumptions of the most commonly used
  % *explicit* models of competition.
  % 
  % Given that conclusions in the explicit model will depend on things
  % like the ratio of widths of the competition and carrying capacity
  % kernel (Dieckmann and Doebelli) or on the details of the spectral
  % composition of the kernsl (Leimar) these departures will at least
  % quantitatively change the conclusions of these models.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Linking to biological traits}
  % OK, but the R* model is still really abstract, and doesn't really
  % map onto traits that we see in nature (things like the LES affect
  % resource use but don't directly map onto it).

  % Ideally what *I'd* like to see is what these kernels look like in
  % trait space in a biological community.  But I'm not much of an
  % empiricist.

  % Instead, consider a mechanistic model where we model competition
  % for light, and incorportate information about trade-offs

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics<1>[height=.8\textheight]{pics/lifecycle}
    \includegraphics<2>[height=.8\textheight]{pics/blackbox}
  \end{center}

  % Perhaps predictably, competition kernels for these traits look
  % decidedly non Gaussian.
\end{frame}

\end{frame}

% Gah, I had an idea here about how to come out of this back to the
% main message, and I've forgotten it.

% Probably something along the lines of: "it seems unlikely that the
% mathematical tricks that drive coexistance in the simple models are
% at play here, or that they're the whole story.  Focussing on the
% simple linear gaussian kernel is mypopic and drives the narrative of
% the field too much."

\begin{frame}{Nothing new under the sun}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Criticism of the LV/ML model is not new.  (perhaps a few
    choice quotes from Abrams 1975, 1980?)
  \item Original papers recognised nonlinearity (back in the 30's!)
    and papers bemoaning the commonness of LV are 30 years old.
  \item Empirical competition kernels depart from constant with
    density are old (e.g., Ayala et al. 1973, Neill 1974, Wilbur 1972,
    Smith-Gill and Gill 1978: all in Abrams 1980 -- find a nice
    figure).
  \item Abrams 2008 shows really screwy competition functions wrt
    traits.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Prospects}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reconsider if the Gaussian-everywhere approach to competition
    is played out.  This is an old call.  It's also one that is
    perhaps getting some traction, though most of the work is being
    published in deeply theoretical places (e.g., work by Dobelli).
  \item Identify features that mechanistic models, models with
    implicit competition, and emprical data have in common and make
    sure that our models that invoke explicit competition are robust
    to these features.
  \item Measuring competition in mechanistic models has potential for
    bridging theory and data.  Unexpected shapes and forms.  May help
    with nonmanipulative estimation of competition intensity in the
    field.  At least that's what I'd like.  It certainly seems
    unlikely to be worse than the current crop of models.

% \begin{frame}[t]{Approach}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Think about what competition \emph{means}
%   \item Start with models with ``explicit competition'' and recover
%     this
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Models where the competition function is baked directly into
%       the model - if we know what it is already, should be able to
%       recover it as a test case.
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item Next, relatively simple models with ``implicit competition''.
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Models where competition \emph{emerges}, e.g., via shared
%       resource use.
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item Complicated mechanistic models with implicit competition based
%     on things we know about species
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Starting with Daniel's vegetation model.
%     \end{itemize}
%   \end{itemize}

% \begin{frame}[t]{Dieckmann and Doebeli 1999 \subt{Gaussian}}
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Key features:
%       \begin{itemize}
%       \item Competition reduces a species carrying capacity via a

%       \item Species effects are linear with respect to density
%       \item Carrying capacity is also Gaussian
%       \end{itemize}
%     \item Other similar models: Doebeli and Dieckmann (2010; Am Nat),

%       \begin{itemize}
%       \item some of these have competition affecting growth rate,

%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item No explicit competition kernel, no explicit carrying
%       capacity
%     \item Species consume shared resources at some rate and convert
%       them into offspring
%     \item Externally specified rate of resource regeneration
%     \item For k resources, up to k species can coexist
%     \item Species ``draw down'' resources to their \Rstar; species
%       with higher requirements die.
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item Terrifying literature of variants and tweaks
%   \item Probably the simplest possible shared resource model
