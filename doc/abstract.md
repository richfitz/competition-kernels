Competition kernels and coexistance

Modelling interspecific competition, and how it varies with species traits, is central to models of coexistance.  In many models, competition is explictly given using a few simple functional forms (e.g., gaussian, sigmoidal) with respect to traits, and act linearly with species abundance.  This approach is disconnected from empirical studies of competition, where such quantities are extremely difficult to measure.  We aim to bridge this gap using models where competition emerges implcitly via the use of common resources; both simple phenomenological models and more complex mechanistic models.  Our results suggest that even in simple models with implicit competition, simple functional forms are often insufficient to capture ecological or evolutionary dynamics.
