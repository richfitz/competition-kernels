Competition kernels and coexistence

Modelling interspecific competition, and how it varies with species traits, is central to theory about coexistence and diversity.  In many models, the competitive effect of one species on another is calculated directly from traits, using simple functional forms (e.g., gaussian, sigmoidal), increasing linearly with species abundance.  This approach is disconnected from empirical studies of competition, where such quantities are extremely difficult to measure.  We aim to bridge this gap using models where competition emerges implicitly via the use of common resources; both simple phenomenological models and more complex mechanistic models.  Our results suggest that even in simple models with implicit competition, simple functional forms are often insufficient to capture ecological or evolutionary dynamics and thus question the widespread use of such functions in current theory.
