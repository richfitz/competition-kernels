# Defining competition

Surprisingly challenging.

> Interspecific competition between species, defined as reciprocal negative effects of one species on another (either directly or indirectly mediated by changes in resource availability)

Also goes on to say:

> In practice, definitions of the effects of interspecific competition have typically fallen into one of three categories: (1) reduction in the average resource intake rate (or some resource-determined component of fitness) of individuals of one species caused by the presence of the competing population; (2) absolute or proportional reduction in population density caused by the presence of a competitor, assuming that coexistence occurs; (3) probability or frequency of competitive exclusion or coexistence among species (including measures of species diversity). Distinguishing the measure being used is crucial, because each of these measures can be affected quite differently by predation.

Possible measures of competition:

* Reduction in resource intake (or individual growth)
* Reduction in density caused by a competitor population
* Ease of coexistence (range of parameter values producing coexistence of competitors)

> The experiments used a nonmechanistic, Lotka-Voterra-based, phenomenological definition of competition: two species compete when an increase in the density of one species leads to a decrease in the density of the other, and vice versa.

> I question ether...the Lotka-Volterra definition of competition, which is based on the interactions of a single pair of species, applies to species living in multispecies communities.

The concern here is not that changing densities etc gives the wrong view, but that focusing on two species is a problem because of all the indirect effects that start appearing when you have more than two species.

> In the four-species community, however, one of the species pairs behaved, in total, as if they were mutualists, and the other two pairs behaved, in total, as if they barely interacted, even though they were strong direct competitors

These are apparently answerable (or things that one could consider answering) which suggests that in 1983 we know a lot about competition:
> How frequently does interspecific competition occur at present in nature; (2) what mechanisms account for the variability in its occurrence; (3) when it does occur, how strong is it compared to intraspecific competition?

> ...how to evaluate relationships between individual plant traits and competitive success

> ...competitive ability can be a rather vague concept that is defined in very many ways by different authors (Milne 1961; Abrams 1987; Goldberg 1990; Grace 1990).

On defining competitive ability:
> The key problem here is that much of formal theory is based on population at equilibrium but the vast majority of experimental work on competition has been at the individual level and short term.

> The magnitude of competition at the individual level can be quantified as the per unit effect of individuals of some neighbour taxon on the response of some target taxon, where "unit" can refer to individuals, biomass or any other measure of abundance, and response is measured as some component of fitness of target individuals at different abundances of the neighbours.  While this single values expresses competitive ability of both taxa in a particular interacting pair, comparisons of this value among taxa, i.e. comparisons of competitive ability, can be done in two distinct ways that have very different interpretations...[1] Comparisons among neighbour species assess ability to suppress other plants or competitive effect, while [2] comparisons among target species assess resistance to suppression or competitive response.

## Schoener (1974) http://www.jstor.org/stable/2459895

> The most general definition of *competition coefficient* is a number giving the degree to which an individual of one species affects through competition the growth or equilibrium level of a second species' population, relative to the effect of an individual of the second species.
